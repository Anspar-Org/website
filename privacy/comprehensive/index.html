    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

    <h3>1.1 About Anspar Foundation</h3>
    <p>Anspar Foundation ("Anspar," "we," "us," or "our") is a technology development organization that builds applications and systems for healthcare, research, and charitable purposes. We work with partner organizations, including patient advocacy foundations, research institutions, and healthcare providers, to develop technology solutions that advance health outcomes and scientific understanding.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Purpose of This Policy</h3>
    <p>This Comprehensive General Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Anspar Foundation collects, uses, shares, protects, and retains personal information across all our activities, projects, and services. This Policy applies to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our website(s) and online services</li>
        <li>Applications and software we develop</li>
        <li>Research projects and clinical studies we support</li>
        <li>Interactions with donors, partners, and collaborators</li>
        <li>Employment and contractor relationships</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Modular Policy Structure</h3>
    <p>This Policy establishes our foundational privacy framework. Because we engage in diverse projects with varying data collection requirements, we use a modular structure:</p>
    <p><strong>Comprehensive General Privacy Policy (This Document):</strong> Establishes core principles, rights, security standards, and governance that apply to all Anspar activities.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="/privacy/">Concise General Privacy Policy</a>:</strong> A summary document containing the essential Policy information necessary to comply with GDPR and other regulations.</p>
    <p><strong>Project Privacy Addenda:</strong> Supplemental documents that specify project-specific data collection, use, sharing, and retention practices. Each addendum incorporates this Policy by reference.</p>
    <p>When you use a specific Anspar project or service, both this Policy and any applicable Project Privacy Addendum govern your information. In the event of a conflict between this Policy and a Project Privacy Addendum, the Project Privacy Addendum controls for that specific project, except that a Project Privacy Addendum may not reduce the core protections and rights established in Sections 6 (Your Rights), 7 (Data Security), and 14 (Complaints) of this Policy.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Regulatory Compliance Framework</h3>
    <p>This Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>United States Federal Laws:</strong> Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act; FDA regulations including 21 CFR Part 11</li>
        <li><strong>European Union Laws:</strong> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679; Clinical Trial Regulation (EU) No 536/2014; EU GMP Annex 11</li>
        <li><strong>California Laws:</strong> California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA); California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA)</li>
        <li><strong>Other U.S. State Laws:</strong> Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and other state privacy laws as applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Specific regulatory requirements for individual projects are detailed in the applicable Project Privacy Addenda.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Transferability and Successor Organizations</h3>
    <p>Anspar Foundation frequently develops technology in partnership with or under contract to other organizations. This Policy is designed to ensure continuity when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A project or its technology is transferred to a partner organization</li>
        <li>Anspar's role changes from developer to supporter, or vice versa</li>
        <li>Organizational restructuring occurs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon any such transfer, existing consents and authorizations remain valid, the successor organization assumes all applicable obligations, and users are notified but are not required to provide new consent for the transfer itself.</p>

    <p><strong>"Data Processor"</strong> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which processes Personal Data on behalf of the Controller.</p>
    <p><strong>"Business Associate"</strong> means a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities involving the use or disclosure of Protected Health Information on behalf of, or provides services to, a Covered Entity, as defined under HIPAA.</p>
